          <li>Most states also have a higher rate of employment for individuals with a GED or high school diploma. Improving chances of obtaining employment in legal proffesions, social service carrers, office and administrative support, and/or sales.</li>
          <li>For those seeking to serve, joining the military is a competitive process but not having a high school diploma will be a disadvantage. Acquiring a GED solves that problem and opens eligibility to different military branches.</li>
